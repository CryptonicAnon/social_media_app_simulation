# social_media_app_simulation
Create a basic social media app simulation where users can create profiles, post content, like and comment on posts, and follow/unfollow others.


User Profiles: Allow users to create profiles with a username, bio, profile picture, and follower/following lists.

Posts: Enable users to create, edit, and delete text/image posts, each with a timestamp.

Like and Comment: Implement a way for users to like posts and add comments with nested replies.

Followers: Users can follow or unfollow other users, influencing what appears on their “feed.”

Feed Generation: Display a timeline/feed with recent posts from followed users.

Notifications: Basic notifications for new followers, comments, and likes (could be console-based or as simple alerts).

Optional - Direct Messages: Allow private messaging between users.

Skills:
Data Storage: Use SQLite or a simple database to store user and post data.
Object-Oriented Design: Design classes for User, Post, Comment, and Notification.
Data Structures: Store relationships (followers, likes, comments) efficiently.
Error Handling: Manage cases like duplicate usernames, non-existent users, and invalid input.
Optional GUI: Add a GUI with Tkinter or a web front-end using Flask for added user experience.
